# Movie Recommendation System 🎬

This project implements a content-based movie recommendation system using Python and machine learning techniques.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Overview
The system analyzes movie metadata such as overview, genres, and keywords to recommend similar movies based on textual similarity.

## How It Works
- Data preprocessing and feature extraction
- Text vectorization using CountVectorizer
- Similarity calculation using cosine similarity
- Recommends movies based on user input

## How to Run
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook
2. Run all cells
3. Call the recommendation function with a movie title

Example:
```python
recommend("Avatar")
